# Logo Instructions

To add your UniFind logo:

1. Place your logo image file in this directory (`static/images/`)
2. Name it `logo.png` (or update the filename in `templates/base.html` if using a different name)
3. Recommended logo specifications:
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Height: 35-50px (width will auto-adjust)
   - Style: Simple, clean design that works well with the blue (#08598b) color scheme

If no logo file is present, the navbar will simply show "UniFind" text without an image.
